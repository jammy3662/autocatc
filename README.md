## AutoCatC
### Cat compiler auto-generated from a formal grammar

This compiler started during the development of minicatc, a hand-written Cat compiler which was becoming increasingly messy and impractical to write manually. 

`autocatc` uses Flex to generate a scanner and Bison to generate a parser.
